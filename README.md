# Lung Cancer Detection

## Overview
This project aims to predict lung cancer based on patient data, including age and smoking status. The model uses logistic regression to classify whether a patient is likely to develop lung cancer.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `healthData.csv`, which contains the following columns:

- **Patient_ID**: Unique identifier for each patient (dropped in the analysis).
- **Age**: Age of the patient.
- **Smoking_Status**: Categorical variable indicating if the patient is a smoker or non-smoker (encoded as 0 for Non-Smoker and 1 for Smoker).
- **Lung_Cancer**: Target variable indicating whether the patient has lung cancer (0 for No, 1 for Yes).
